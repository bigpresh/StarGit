    <h3 id="whatisstargit">What is StarGit</h3>

    StarGit is built on top of SiGMa, a flash application to explore a graph, written by <a href="http://ofnodesandedges.com">Alexis Jacomy</a>.<br />

    With StarGit, you're invited to explore the graph of GitHub's profiles.
    
    <h3 id="howtoread">How to read the graph</h3>

    When you look for a profile, if the user has ever received some contributions on one of his projects, you'll get his graph with the people who had contributed.

    <h3 id="howtonavigate">How to navigate in the graph</h3>

    In a graph, you can:

    <ul>
      <li>zoom (while scrolling with your mouse)</li>
      <li>move your cursor over a node to display information about a node</li>
      <li>click on a node, to navigate to the graph of this user</li>
    </ul>

    StarGit was created by <a href="http://lumberjaph.net">Franck Cuny</a> and <a href="http://ofnodesandedges.com">Alexi Jacomy</a>.
